# beaker-puppet: The Puppet-Specific Beaker Library

The purpose of this library is to hold all puppet-specific info & DSL methods.
This includes all helper & installer methods.

It might not be up to that state yet, but that's the goal for this library. If
you see anything puppet-specific that you'd like to pull into this library out
of beaker, please do, we would love any help that you'd like to provide.
